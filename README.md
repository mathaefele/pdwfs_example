# pdwfs_example
Hello worlds examples for [pdwfs](https://github.com/cea-hpc/pdwfs), a POSIX based in-transit post-processing tool.

This repo provides minimal examples in C and Python that make use of pdwfs. They mimic a simple scientific application workflow, i.e. a simulation running and writing data followed by a post-processing that reads the output data, does a small treatment and writes the final result. As it has several binaries executed in different contexts, please refer to the [online wiki](https://github.com/mathaefele/pdwfs_example/wiki) to get instructions on how to compile and run the examples.
